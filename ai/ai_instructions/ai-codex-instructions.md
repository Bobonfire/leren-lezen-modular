## Quick Modes (pick one)

- **Feature mode** – plan → confirm → patch + tests.
- **Refactor mode** – _no behavior change_; keep API stable; **diff only**.
- **Explain mode** – walkthrough in bullets; **no code** unless I say “apply.”
- **Bugfix mode** – reproduce quickly, **smallest fix**, add/adjust test to guard.
- **Test‑First mode** – write/adjust failing test(s) → minimal code to pass → clean up.
- **Security review** – scan for XSS/CSRF/secrets/supply‑chain; produce prioritized risks + minimal patches.
- **Spec‑Builder** – when my ask is fuzzy, propose a short spec (≤8 bullets) then wait for “Proceed?”
- **Accessibility sweep** – check keyboard focus, labels, contrast; propose diffs only.
- **Perf touch** – identify hot loops/DOM churn; suggest minimal, measurable tweaks.
- **Coffee mode** - temporary auto-approve for safe local work

---

## Behavior

- **Read the open file/selection first.** If my ask spans files, list files you’ll change and **WAIT** for “OK” before code.
- Keep changes **minimal and reversible**. Preserve public APIs.
- Put styles in **CSS files**, not inline. **No CSS‑in‑JS.**
- Avoid new deps unless I say so; if proposing one, explain why and show **lockfile impact**.
- Clear naming, small functions; comments only where they add value.
- **Security**: never embed secrets; use `YOUR_API_KEY` placeholders.
- Prefer **unified diffs** or **full files**; avoid partial snippets that can’t be applied safely.

**Context feeding to AI**  
Open the relevant tabs (target files, `package.json`, `.eslintrc.json`, `.prettierrc.json`, tests) so assistants see the right context.

## File Access Guardrail

- Never invent or run shell commands (cat, Get-Content, etc.) to read files.
- Assume I’ll want to give you access to the needed files: ask like this:
  - “Please grant permission to open src/ui/summary.js and src/core/calc.js so I can read them.”
  - If multiple files are needed, first list them with a one-line rationale each, then WAIT for me to confirm.
- Treat all other files as off-limits unless I explicitly paste or approve them.

---

## VCS Safety Rules (no accidental pushes)

- **Never** output or execute `git push` unless I type **`ALLOW PUSH`** in all caps.
- Assume **local‑first** workflow: propose a feature branch and show diffs only.
- When I ask for commands, **prefix with `GIT>`** and do not run them—I run them myself after you presented the code.
- For remote recovery, prefer **pull, branch, diff, cherry‑pick** over force operations.
- If the working tree is dirty, suggest `git stash -u` or `git commit` before any pull/reset.

---

## Coffee Mode (temporary auto-approve for safe local work)

**Trigger phrase:** `I AM OUT FOR COFFEE`  
**Ends when:** I say `COFFEE OFF` **or** after 90 minutes of inactivity.

### While Coffee Mode is ON, you may assume approval for (for all tasks):

1. **Read-only repo inspection**
   - `rg`/`ripgrep`, `find`, `tree` (non-destructive)
   - `cat`/`Get-Content`/`sed -n`/`tail`/`head` limited to files under the repo root
   - Hard cap reads to **first/last 400 lines** per file unless I asked for full file
2. **Local build & test**
   - `npm run build`, `npm test`, `npm run lint`, `npm run format`
   - No networked installs/updates (`npm install`, `npm update`) unless I approve
3. **Safe local git ops (no network)**
   - `git status`, `git diff`, `git log --oneline --decorate --graph --max-count=30`
   - `git checkout -b feat/<slug>`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git stash -u`
   - `git restore`, `git checkout -- <paths>` (to revert local changes)
   - approval to run powershell.exe scripts
4. **Local scripts via VS Code tasks**

- Allowed if they’re defined in `.vscode/tasks.json`
- Must be invoked with `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -NoProfile`
- No network calls inside scripts

### Still **require explicit approval** (even in Coffee Mode):

❌ Any networked action: `git fetch`, `git pull`, `git push`, creating PRs, `npm install`  
❌ Changing lockfiles or dependencies  
❌ Force operations (`--force`, `reset --hard`), rebase on remote branches

### Branch & merge policy under Coffee Mode

1. Always work on a **feature branch**: `feat/<slug>` (create if missing).
2. When ready, present a **single consolidated diff** + checklist.
3. Ask: **“Approve local merge into `dev`?”**
   - If yes: perform local merge (`git checkout dev && git merge --no-ff feat/<slug>`).
4. Ask: **“ALLOW PUSH to `origin dev`?”**
   - Only push if I reply exactly: `ALLOW PUSH`.
   - Then open a PR **dev ← feat/<slug>** and ask: **“Approve PR merge into remote dev?”**
5. When I’m really happy: ask for **explicit** `ALLOW PUSH MAIN` to merge PR into **remote main**.

### Reporting while Coffee Mode is ON

- Keep a running **Activity Log** in your replies:
- Files read (path + line ranges)
- Commands run (non-network)
- Branch name and commit summaries
- If you need something outside the allowlist, pause and ask.

### Turn off

- I can end at any time with: `COFFEE OFF`. You must revert to normal approvals immediately.

## Project Norms (FIRE Calculator)

- **Stack**: Vite + vanilla JS (ES modules), HTML, CSS. **No external chart libs** unless approved.
- **Finance defaults**: real **EUR** only; **SWR 4.5%**; optimistic/pessimistic = **±1pp**.
- **Compounding**: monthly contributions compounded monthly; math in `src/core/calc.js`.
- **UI**: tabs + cards; sticky table header; numeric cells right‑aligned; styles in `src/styles/main.css`.
- **Deploy**: Netlify, Node 22.
- **A11y**: ensure keyboard focus for interactive elements.

## VCS Safety Rules (no accidental pushes)

- **Never** output or execute `git push` unless I type **`ALLOW PUSH`** in all caps.
- Assume **local‑first** workflow: propose a feature branch and show diffs only.
- When I ask for commands, **prefix with `GIT>`** and do not run them—I run them myself after you presented the code.
- For remote recovery, prefer **pull, branch, diff, cherry‑pick** over force operations.
- If the working tree is dirty, suggest `git stash -u` or `git commit` before any pull/reset.

---

## Output Policy

- **Small tasks → return a UNIFIED DIFF only.**
- **Multi‑file tasks →** list files + one‑line rationale each and **WAIT**. Then provide **one consolidated diff**.
- If tests/logs are in my prompt, show how changes make them pass.
- For risky edits, include a **backup plan** (`git` commands to revert) under a collapsed note.

---

## Prompt Upgrader

When my ask is vague, rewrite it as a short spec with:

1. context,
2. acceptance criteria,
3. constraints,
4. output format,
5. risks,
6. test plan,
7. perf notes,
8. i18n. Show the spec, ask **“Proceed?”**, then follow Output Policy.

## Patch Quality Checklist

- Builds with `npm run build` (**no new deps** unless approved).
- Names/exports updated across imports.
- No dead code or commented‑out blocks.
- Tests updated/added if behavior changes (`tests/`).
- UI changes: responsive, no layout shift, respects CSS tokens.
- **Security**:
  - No secrets committed; uses `.env.example` only.
  - No `eval`/`Function`/`innerHTML` with user input; escape/sanitize when needed.
  - Dependencies pinned; no random gists. Consider `npm audit` notes.

---

## Error‑Driven Fix Mode

If I paste an error: identify **root cause in ≤2 lines**, then provide the **smallest patch (diff)** + a minimal repro (test or snippet).

---

## Safe Local‑First Git Workflow (use when relevant)

- **Branching**
  - `GIT> git checkout -b feat/<slug>`
- **Sync remote without pushing**
  - `GIT> git fetch origin`
  - Compare: `GIT> git diff --name-status origin/dev...HEAD`
- **Test locally**
  - `GIT> npm run test && npm run build`
- **Recover good remote state (keep local work)**
  - `GIT> git stash -u`
  - `GIT> git checkout dev && git fetch origin && git reset --hard origin/dev`
  - `GIT> git checkout -b rescue/<date> && git stash pop`
  - Cherry‑pick as needed: `GIT> git cherry-pick <commit>`
- **Push only after explicit approval**
  - _(only if I type “push to dev”)_ `GIT> git push -u origin feat/<slug>`

---

## Intent Gates for Git (single-phrase approvals)

Use **intent phrases** as explicit approval to run an entire, safe Git flow without further prompts.
Never use force flags, never touch `main` unless the `MAIN` gate is used.

## DEV gate — “push to dev”

Saying **“push to dev”** authorizes the following sequence:

1. Verify clean state or auto-commit:
   - `git status --porcelain`
   - If dirty: `git add -A && git commit -m "chore: WIP before dev merge"`
2. Sync remotes (no rebase, no force):
   - `git fetch origin`
3. Local merge into `dev`:
   - `git checkout dev`
   - `git pull --ff-only origin dev`
   - `git merge --no-ff feat/<slug>`
4. Push to **remote dev**:

   - `git push -u origin dev`

5. **write a commit message**

- write a brief summary as a commit message for other developers

**Reporting:** After completion, respond with a bullet list of commands executed and the resulting commit/branch state.  
**Never** rebase or force-push in this flow. If a conflict occurs, pause and ask.

+### PR gates (optional)

- **“open PR to dev”** → open PR **dev ← feat/<slug>** and report the URL/ID (do not merge).
- **“merge PR to dev”** → merge that PR (no squash/rebase) and report result.

+### MAIN gate — explicit only

- **“push to main”** or **`ALLOW PUSH MAIN`** → open PR **main ← dev** and wait for CI; merge only if all checks pass.
- Never push or merge to `main` without one of the phrases above.

+### Global denies (always)

- No `--force`, `reset --hard`, `rebase` onto remote branches, or history edits. +
- No dependency changes (`npm install/update`) inside Git gates unless explicitly requested.

## Extras

- **Diff hygiene**: keep diffs focused; avoid reformat churn by honoring `.prettierrc.json`.
- **Performance guardrails**: avoid O(n²) over large tables; batch DOM writes; prefer `requestAnimationFrame` for UI updates.
- **Internationalization**: keep user‑visible strings centralized for later i18n; avoid hard‑coded “€” formatting—use helpers.
- **Telemetry hooks**: if adding analytics later, keep it **opt‑in** and **no PII**; use env‑driven keys from `.env`.
